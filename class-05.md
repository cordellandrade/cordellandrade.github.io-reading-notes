## Images
- To add images to a webpage users use the <img> element; using the src attribute to locate the source of the image and an alt attribute to describe the contents of the image.
- Users can change the size of the image to best fit their webpage using css.
 
 ## Color
- Users can add color to their webpages by using css.
- The three ways to specify colors in css are RGB values, hex codes and color names.
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows users to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value known as HSLA.
 
 ## Text
- Users can change the values of text in HTML by using CSS to change font, size, weight, and spacing of the text.
- Users also can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
- Users can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
