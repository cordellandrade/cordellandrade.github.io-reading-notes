# Class 13 Reading Summary

## Storage
- Local storage is one of the areas where native client apps holds an advantage over web apps.
- For native apps, the operating system typically provide an abstration layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data like preferences or runtime state; These values may be stored in the registry, INI files, XML files, or some other place according to platform convention.
- Cookies were invented early in the web's history which can be used for perfsistent local storage of small amounts of data but they have three downsides:
* Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
* Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)
* Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data â€” enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful
