# Class 7 Reading Summary

## Domain Modeling
- The process of creating conceptual model in code for specific problems; The model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors. An Entity that stores data in properties and captures behaviors in methods is referred to as an object-oriented model.

Object-oriented programming in JavaScript at its most fundamental level includes:

1. The new keyword instantiates (i.e. creates) an object.
1. The constructor function initializes properties inside that object using the this variable.
1. The object is stored in a variable for later use.

## Tables

- The ```<table>``` element is used to add tables to a web
page and is created out row by row. Each row is created
with the ```<tr>``` element.
- Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the ```<td>``` element (or ```<th>``` if it is a
header).
- Users can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.
- For long tables users can split the table into a ```<thead>```,
```<tbody>```, and ```<tfoot>```.

## Functions, Methods, and Objects

- Functions allow users to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.
Functions can take parameters (information required
to do their job) and may return a value.

- An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around users;
In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.
Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.

- JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
