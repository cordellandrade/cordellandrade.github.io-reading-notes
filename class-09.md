# Class 9 Reading Summary
 ## Forms
- When users want to collect info from visitors to their sites they will need a form which can be created using the <form> element.
- Information from a form is sent in **name/value pairs.
Each form control is given names which the text the user types in or the value of the options they select are sent to the server.
 
 # Lists, Tables & Forms
- List markers can be given different appearances using the list-style-type and list-style image properties.
- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.
- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
- Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.
 # Events
- Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened, like when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked.
- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon; When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function.
- When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.
