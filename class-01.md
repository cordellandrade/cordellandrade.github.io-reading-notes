# Class 1 Reading Summary

## Introduction 
-Users access websites using software called web browsers ex. Firefox and Chrome
- When users ask the browser for a web page the request is sent across the internet to a unique computer called the **web server** which hosts the website.
- Web servers are special computers that are always connected to the Internet.
- Users can access websites through a range of devices like desktops, laptops, phones and tablets.
- Websites are created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- When users visit a website, that website could be locatd any where in the world; To find the locatation of the web server your browser will first connect to a **Domain Name System** (*DNS*) server.
- When users connect to the web, they do so via a **Internet Service Provider** (*ISP*). They will type a domain name or web server to a site like google.com then their computer will contact a network of servers called the DNS servers which act like phone books (They tell the computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name.)
- An IP address is a number up to 12 digits seperated by period / full stops; Every computer connected to the internet has a unique IP address which acts like the computer's phone number.

## Structure 
-HTML pages are text documents that use tags to **give information they surround special meaning**.
-Tag are *usually* in pairs; An opening tag and a closing tag.
-Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element; they are made up of two parts: a **name** and a **value**,
separated by an equals sign.

## Extra Markup
-Doctypes tell browsers which version of HTML the user is using.
-You can add comments to your code by using "<!-- comments are written here -->" markers.
-The **id** and **class** attributes allows users to identify special elements.
-The '<meta>' tag allows users to supply all kinds of information about the web page the user is creating.

## HTML5 Layout
-HTML5 is a new version of HTML that elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page, helps to describe its structure, and provide clearer code.

## Process & Design 
-Site maps allows users to plan the structure of their website.
-Wireframes allows users to organize the information that will go on each page of their site.
-Users can differentiate pieces of information using size, color, and style.

## The ABC of Programming
-Script in Javascript is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
-Computers approach taks differently than users so instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.
