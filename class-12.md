## Chart.js
- A chart is a far better tool for displaying data visually than tables, they're far appealling visually to understand however not always easy to create.
- Chart.js is a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5's canvas element to draw the graph onto the page; making usage of bar charts, line charts and pie charts; To use Chart.js users will have to copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory they will be working in, then create a new html page and import the script.

## Canvas Element
- The <canvas> element visually resembles the <img> element but the main differences it doesn't make usage of the src and alt attributes and having a closing canvas tag. It instead uses two other attributes which are width and height.

- Using canvas you can get really creative and implement shapes, text, paths, apply styles and colors.
