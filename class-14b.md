He had worked at a consulting firm
Then she became a researcher at Harvard, She applied to business schools and was accepted by the Yale School of Management.
Every day, between classes or after dinner, Rozovsky and her four teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. Everyone was smart and curious, and they had a lot in common: They had gone to similar colleges and had worked at analogous firms.
