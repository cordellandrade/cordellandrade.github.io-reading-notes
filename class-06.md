# Class 6 Reading Summary

## Object Literals
- Objects group togther variables and functions to create a model of something from the real world where variables and functions take on new names.
- In objects, variables are known as properties which tell us about the object whereas functions become methods in objects. -Properties and methods have name and values in objects, where that name is called a key; An object cannot have two keys with the same name.
- The value of a property can be a string, number, boolean, array or even another object; The value of a method is always a function.
 ## Creating an object
- Users can create objects using literal notation but there are other ways to create objects.
The object is the curly braces and their contents, and is stored in the variable set.
- After creating an object, you can update it later on outside the object by coding "object.propertyName = 'property value';".

### Document Object Model
- The browser represents the page using a DOM tree where the DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

- Users can select element nodes by their id or cl ass attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.

- From an element node, users can access and update its content using properties. An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
