## Structural Markup
- To provide extra meaning to your webpage you can use *structural markup* such as ```<h1>, <p>, <b>,``` to describe headings and paragraphs.
- You can also use ```<br> and <hr>``` to break your page into parts.

- You can use text elements that do not affect the structure of your web page but add extra information to them.
- Text elements such as ```<strong>, <em>``` are categorized as semantic markup.

## Introducing CSS
- CSS creates the effect that each html elements appear to be inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that elements should look.

- The rules are made up of selectors and declarations, different types selectors allows users to target rules at different elements whereas declarations are made up of two parts: The properties of the element that the user wants to change and the values of those properties.

-CSS rules normally appear in a separate text file (style.css) although you can apply them within a html doc.

 ## Basic Javascript Instructions
- A script is a series of statements which act like a step of a recipe in a cookbook; They contain very precise instructions.

- Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in scripts. Ex. var, let, const.

- Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information.

- Javascript uses different types of data types; Numbers (0-9), strings ('text'), and boolean (true or false).

 ## Decisions and Loops
- Decision uses the results of the evaluations to decide which path the users script should go.

- There are three types of loops; For, While and do...while loops.
