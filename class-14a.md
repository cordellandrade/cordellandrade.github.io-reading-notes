# Class 14 Reading Summary

## Transform Syntax*
- Syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.
# 2D Scaling Functions: scale, scaleX, and scaleY
- 3D transforms use the same transform property used for 2D transforms. If you’re familiar with 2D transforms, you’ll find the basic 3D transform functions similar.
1. rotateX( angle )
1. rotateY( angle )
1. rotateZ( angle )
1. ( tz )
1. scaleZ( sz )
- Animations When multiple transitions are required, the transition property becomes obsolete and the animation property becomes the focus. To set multiple points at which an element should transition, we use the @keyframes rule, which includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
